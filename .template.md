#### Isolation: Each tenant has its own dedicated schema, ensuring data privacy and isolation among tenants.

#### Simplified Database Management: Instead of maintaining separate databases for each tenant, you only need to manage one database with multiple schemas. This can lead to easier backup, replication, and maintenance.

#### Scalability: As the number of tenants grows, adding a new schema for each new tenant is straightforward without needing to spin up new database instances.

#### Uniformity: All tenants share the same database structure (though not the data). This can simplify the application logic as you don't have to handle variations in database structures among tenants.

#### Cost-Effective: With schema-based multi-tenancy, you can efficiently utilize a single database connection pool for multiple tenants, leading to better resource utilization and potential cost savings.

#### Flexibility: It's easier to customize or provide tenant-specific features or structures. You can make modifications in a particular tenant's schema without affecting others.

#### Integrated Security with Spring Boot: Utilizing Spring Boot's security features, you can ensure secure access and operations specific to each tenant.

#### Consistent Application Logic: Since the separation is at the database schema level, the application logic remains consistent across all tenants. There's no need to write tenant-specific code in the application layer.

#### Ease of Migration: If a particular tenant grows substantially and needs to be moved to its own database, migration from a schema to a separate database can be more straightforward than other multi-tenancy approaches.

#### Operational Efficiency: Monitoring, backups, and other operational tasks can be streamlined, as they are performed on a single database instance.
